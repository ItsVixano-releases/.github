# Giovanni Unofficial LineageOS Builds

```c
#include <std/disclaimer.h>
/*
 * While these builds are heavily optimized, they are also capable of pushing
 * your phone much harder. I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards,
 * thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please
 * do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM
 * before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if
 * you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
